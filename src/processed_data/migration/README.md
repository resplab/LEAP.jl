# Immigration and Emigration in Canada

## Population Data

The data for the population was generated from the StatsCan website. For the years 2001-2019, we
used Table 17-10-0005-01, and for the years 2020-2065, we used Table 17-10-0057-01:

2001-2019: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710000501
2020-2065: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710005701

Note: For the latter table, the projection goes to 2065 for Canada, but only to 2043 for the
provinces.

Since StatsCan does not provide a breakdown of population projections/estimates by emigration
or immigration, we calculated the average number of individuals required to emigrate/immigrate to
match the projected demographics. These results are saved in:

`master_emigration_table.csv`
`master_immigration_table.csv`

# PM2.5 Projections for IPCC Scenarios

The data in this folder details the projections for the years 2024-2036 based on the
Shared Socioeconomic Pathways climate change scenarios.

SSP1: Sustainability
SSP2: Middle of the Road
SSP3: Regional Rivalry
SSP4: Inequality
SSP5: Fossil-fueled Development

Within each of these scenarios, there are different categories based on global temperature increase
and greenhouse gas emissions. We have chosen to include the following in our app:

SSP1-2.6:
  Very likely range of warming: 1.3 - 2.4 degrees Celsius by 2081-2100
  Low greenhouse gas emissions
  CO2 emissions cut to net zero by 2075

SSP2-4.5:
  Very likely range of warming: 2.1 - 3.5 degrees Celsius by 2081-2100
  Intermediate greenhouse gas emissions
  CO2 emissions around current levels until 2050, then falling but not reaching net zero by 2100

SSP3-7.0:
  Very likely range of warming: 2.8 - 4.6 degrees Celsius by 2081-2100
  High greenhouse gas emissions
  CO2 emissions double by 2100

SSP5-8.5:
  Very likely range of warming: 3.3 - 5.7 degrees Celsius by 2081-2100
  Very high greenhouse gas emissions
  CO2 emissions triple by 2075
